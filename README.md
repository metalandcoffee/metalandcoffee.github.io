# [themetalhead.dev](themetalhead.dev)

Simple landing page in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Development
When running this project locally, make sure to use to the npm package [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) in order serve the website on a local web server and be able to run the JavaScript files locally (You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) install for this). 

For security reasons, modern browsers won't load resource from locally running HTML files (files using `file://` protocol in the address bar).

The easiest way to get a modern browser to load and run JavaScript files in local HTML files is to run a local web server.
